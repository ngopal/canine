Data Cleaning, Extraction, and Calculation
For both the vector copy and transgene data, the colors in the visualization reflect the average value of each anatomical part in its dose category (low-, mid-, and high-dose). Non-treated dogs were not used for any calculations or depictions. For the VCN data, this average was calculated over both sides of the dog, as the spreadsheet contained data for both the left- and right- sides. The transgene spreadsheet did not contain data for each side. Missing values were not included in the denominator when calculating the average (as doing so would incorrectly produce lower average values). The “ND” values in the transgene spreadsheet was treated as a missing value.

Color Scales
For both the vector copy number and transgene data, the distribution of the data is approximately linear for values between 0-3. Past the value of 3, measured values are consistently higher than expected. To ensure the linear color scale is perceptually accurate, both of the color scales used for vector copy data and transgene expression data range from 0-3, and consider any values higher than 3 to be an outlier, which appear in darker colors. The red linear color scale ranging from 0-3 captures 94% of the data, with the remaining 6% (outliers) represented in dark red in the figure. The green linear color scale ranging from 0-3 captures 95% of the data, with the remaining 5% (outliers) represented in dark green in the figure. Two different colors were chosen to differentiate between vector copy and transgene expression.
